What is my game about:
-So my game is basically a college life simulator, but it's meant to be chill and kind of funny while still realistic. You play as a student (me, technically), and the game gives you stats like GPA, stress level, and social points. Based on your choices—like how heavy your course load is, what subject you study, and whether or not you make a study plan—you get different outcomes for your semester.

Which Branching Concepts are demonstrated:
-Choice Branching, Nested Conditions, Multiple Condition Outcomes, Dynamic Endings

How to run game:
Step 1: Make sure Python 3 is installed on your computer.
Step 2: Copy the code into any Python editor (like Thonny, VSCode, or even an online compiler like Replit).
Step 3: Run the script and answer the questions it asks (you’ll type in stuff like “A” or “Programming” when it asks).
It runs in the terminal/console and updates your stats at the end.

What the endings represent:
-"You're him brodigy!" → You’re doing great, have a plan, and will definitely succeed. Basically, you’re that guy.
-"You're making it work." → You’ve got the grades but no plan, so you’re coasting. Still might make it, but need to stay focused.
-"You'll get there." → You’ve got a plan but your GPA's mid. The game encourages you to keep grinding.
-"You're cooked gang." → This means your GPA isn’t great and you don’t have a study plan… so you're on thin ice, but it still has hope.
-"You're fried I can't lie." → Basically a roast. No study plan + low GPA = serious trouble. It’s meant to make you laugh and wake up.

AI assistance: 
-ChatGPT (OpenAI) – Helped me figure out how to write the branching logic cleanly and fix a couple of logic bugs.
